			Cypress CapSense devices programming support
			--------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

This driver implements the programming for Linux of Cypress CapSense devices by
simulating host sourced programming protocol (HSSP) on GPIO pins.
By using this driver you can reprogram the in-system flash without additional
adapters. This solution is working with blank or non-blank flash memory.
Current release was tested with CY8C4014LQI CapSense device.

Required properties:
 - compatible:    Should be "cypress,cycapsense_hssp"
 - label:         IC type name, it is used to identify firmware file name
 - silicon_id:    IC type identifier, used to identify connected IC.
 - block_size:    In-system flash memory block size
 - num_of_blocks: Number of flash memory blocks.
 - secure_bytes:  Number secure bytes;
 - gpios :        Three interface gpio pins. Index 0 is reset line,
				index 1 - clock line, index 2 - data line.
Optional properties:
 - use-raw-gpio-rw: Do direct register read/write to get/set GPIO,
 - gpio_base_addr:  Address of GPIO IO block;
 - gpio_base_size:  Size of GPIO IO block;

Using the driver
----------------

Once the driver is loaded you can use sysfs support to erase or to program
in-system flash memory.

1. Program firmware will be automatically loaded from file with
name defined by label option presented in directory
/system/etc/firmware.
Firmware will be flashed if checksum in hex file does not match
with checksum of in-system flash memory:
To flash FW:

#echo 1 > /sys/class/capsense/fw_update

2. Program firmware without checking name and checksum. If file <file_name>.hex
is present in /system/etc/firmware directory you may program it with following
command:

#echo <file_name>.hex > /sys/class/capsense/fw_update

3. To erase in-system flash memory:

#echo erase > /sys/class/capsense/fw_update

4. To use driver from another module there is exported API cycapsense_fw_update,
which implements same logic as case #1 above.

5. To reset IC:

#echo reset > /sys/class/capsense/fw_update
or
#echo 1 > /sys/class/capsense/reset
